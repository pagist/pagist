Pagist: Turn a Gist into a nice looking web page
================================================

Pagist is a small web app that turns a Gist into a nice-looking web page.

[MathJax](http://mathjax.com/) is included so you can write beautiful math. [__See an example!__](http://pagist.github.com/?3899155)

Contributions welcomed!


How To Use
----------

Go to [gist.github.com](https://gist.github.com/) and create a Gist.

* The description of the Gist becomes the page title.
* Make sure to put in the filename as `something.md`, and write something in Markdown.

Now, from a Gist URL, let's say, https://gist.github.com/3899155

1. Remove the `s` from `https.`
2. Insert `pa` before `gist`.

The URL becomes http://pagist.github.com/3899155
